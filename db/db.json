After years of painstaking research, the Republic finally developed autonomous drones of their own, turning the one-sided struggle into a war without casualties-or at least, that’s what the government claims.<br>\nIn truth, there is no such thing as a bloodless war.

Having devoted his life to statecraft and his subjects’ well-being, his one unfulfilled wish is to live again, for himself this time: a warrior’s life he’d devoted himself to before his rise to power. His patron goddess, Alistia, hears his plea and smiles upon him, flinging his soul into the far future. Goddesses work in mysterious ways—not only is Inglis now the daughter of a minor noble family, but at her first coming-of-age ceremony at 6, she’s found ineligible to begin her knighthood! However, for a lady of Inglis’s ambition, this is less a setback and more the challenge she was (re)born to overcome. “It’s not the blood that runs through your veins that makes a knight; it’s the blood you shed on the battlefield!” The curtain rises on the legend of an extraordinary lady squire reborn to master the blade!","index":1},{"books":[{"book":"Volume 01","link":"\"https://ouo.io/e3m3Vu\""},{"book":"Volume 02","link":"\"https://ouo.io/MVOL5c0\""},{"book":"Volume 03","link":"\"https://ouo.io/JxQ6wza\""},{"book":"Volume 04","link":"\"https://ouo.io/1YQwrd\""},{"book":"Volume 05","link":"\"https://ouo.io/k40PHa\""},{"book":"Volume 06","link":"\"https://ouo.io/DebA1k\""},{"book":"Volume 07","link":"\"https://bit.ly/3764Ap6\""},{"book":"Volume 08","link":"\"https://ouo.io/6lsmHq\""},{"book":"Volume 09","link":"\"https://ouo.io/8TscLy\""},{"book":"Volume 10","link":"\"https://ouo.io/E4eLsf\""},{"book":"Volume 11","link":"\"https://ouo.io/DGJa7n\""}],"link":"sword-art-online-alternative","title":"Sword Art Online Alternative – Gun Gale Online","serarch":["sword-art-online-alternative","sword art online alternative","SAO alternative"],"pic":"https://i0.wp.com/thatnovelcorner.com/wp2/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/48111.jpeg?w=350&ssl=1","summary":"A Brand-New Battlefield Awaits!<br>\nKaren Kohiruimaki is a college student who stands at an imposing six feet.
